Linux Introduction

- Linux borrows heavily from the UNIX operating system, with which its creators were well versed. 
- Linux accesses many features and services through files and file-like objects.
- Linux is a fully multitasking, multiuser operating system, with built-in networking and service processes known as daemons.
- Linux is developed by a loose confederation of developers from all over the world, collaborating over the Internet, 
with Linus Torvalds at the head. Technical skill and a desire to contribute are the only qualifications for participating.
