Linux Introduction

- Linux borrows heavily from the UNIX operating system, with which its creators were well versed. 
- Linux accesses many features and services through files and file-like objects.
- Linux is a fully multitasking, multiuser operating system, with built-in networking and service processes known as daemons.
- Linux is developed by a loose confederation of developers from all over the world, collaborating over the Internet, 
with Linus Torvalds at the head. Technical skill and a desire to contribute are the only qualifications for participating.
- The Linux community is a far reaching ecosystem of developers, vendors, and users that supports and advances the Linux operating system.
- Some of the common terms used in Linux are: Kernel, Distribution, Boot loader, Service, Filesystem, X Window system, desktop environment, and command line.
- A full Linux distribution consists of the kernel plus a number of other software tools for file-related operations, user management, and software package management.
